BPPRC
=====

BPPRC is a collection of pesticidal proteins. This project is the successor to the existing Bt toxin nomenclature site[http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/].
The existing site provides an accepted framework for the naming of proteins used by industry and academia within the field of arthropod management. The BPPRC hosts information
on the wider range of proteins now being considered for pest control and will also provide a host of bioinformatics procedures to help inform regulators and other stakeholders
with respect to protein properties such as specificity. The revised system for the classification of pesticidal proteins has been designed and currently automated the required analyses.
A database containing the protein sequences has also been set up and a basic user interface prepared.

Entry                   Note
ID                      a unique identifier for each protein
Name                    The new name of the pesticidal protein
Oldname                 The old name of the pesticidal protein
Accession Number        NCBI accession number linked to NCBI
Year                    Published year


Currently we categorized the pesticidal proteins into the following categories

      App: Pesticidal proteins with a predominately Alpha helical structure, e.g. those previously known as Cry6
      Cry: Mnemonic retained for 3-domain proteins
      Cyt: Mnemonic retained for Cyt related proteins
      Gpp: Pesticidal proteins with homology to the aeGerolysins, e.g. those previously known as Cry34
      Mcf: Pesticidal proteins related to Mcf toxins
      Mpp: Pesticidal proteins with homology to the the Mtx/Etx family
      Mtx: Pesticidal protein related to Mtx1 toxins
      Spp: Pesticidal protein related to sphaericolysin toxins
      Tpp: Pesticidal proteins with homology to the Toxin_10/Bin family
      Vip: Mnemonic retained for Vip3 proteins
      Vpa: Pesticidal proteins related to Vip2 catalytic component
      Vpb: Binding partner of the Vip1/2 binary toxin, previously known as Vip1
      Xpp: A holding name for proteins with currently unclassified homology groups
