Welcome to BPPRC's documentation!
=================================

**BPPRC** The pesticidal protein database is part of the `Bacterial Pesticidal Protein Resource Center <http://www.bpprc.org/>`_. This database is intended to replace and extend the old *Bacillus thuringiens* is toxin nomenclature site. The database currently contains proteins listed in the Bt nomenclature site but with new mnemonics to reflect the assignment of proteins to different homology groups. New bacteria-derived proteins with pesticidal properties have also been added. This site allows users to find the best matches within the database to their own sequence. Database sequences can be downloaded and analysed in various ways.
