<b>Welcome to Pesticidal Protein Database</b>
<br>
<br>
<div>
	<p>The pesticidal protein database is part of the Bacterial Pesticidal Protein Resource Center (BPPRC), which is under development.
    This database is intended to replace and extend the current
		<i> Bacillus thuringiensis </i> nomenclature site
		<a href="http://www.btnomenclature.info/" target="_blank" >http://www.btnomenclature.info</a>.
	</p>
	<p>The database currently contains proteins listed in the Bt nomenclature site but with new mnemonics to reflect assignment of proteins to different homology groups.
    New bacteria-derived proteins with pesticidal properties are to be added.</p>
	<p>In addition to the database, the BPPRC will contain links to additional information about these proteins,
    as well as applications to allow for analysis and comparison between proteins.</p>
	<p>The development team is composed of: </p>
