        <p>
          No. Even though you can identify the most closely related proteins, you can only acquire an official name by use of this site.  Self-naming of proteins will inevitably lead to different users adopting the same protein name, confusing the literature.  Only the nomenclature committee can issue new protein names.

        <h4>My protein is completely different. Should I refer to it as Xpp-like?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-7">
        <p>
          No. Xpp is a holding group containing members of several disparate protein families.  As a result, Xpp-like would not actually indicate any significant homology.  You could however, refer to your protein in relation to a specific Xpp protein (as Xpp37-like for example). The numeric value will be retained when the protein is re-categorized to a specific protein family in the future.

        <h4>I have a pesticidal protein derived from a fern. Can I add this sequence to the database?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-7">
        <p>
          Probably not.  This site only aims to deal with proteins of bacterial origin.  However, if your protein of non-bacterial origin has a high degree of identity with a protein that is already in the database, you may make a case for its inclusion.  The committee will consider these requests on a case-by-case basis.
